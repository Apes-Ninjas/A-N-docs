# Treasury

## Proceed of funds

Using a digital wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or a wallet compatible with [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) distinguished members of the crypto community will be able to acquire Access Tokens that will have the form of Apes or Ninjas, depending on the score their wallet gets.

Direct sales of the first generation of Ninjas will enter directly to the treasury, and the sales of Apes belonging to a Clan will be split 50%/50% between the head of the Clan and the A&N Platform

## Management of Funds

Ether contributions will be wrapped as ERC-20 tokens (wETH) to allow for a seamless interaction with The A&N DAO smart contracts (described further [here](/SmartContracts)). The management of these funds will be done by the A&N DAO

## Pre-DAO use of funds

The funds that are raised before the DAO is launched will be administered by a MultiSig wallet, that will be controlled by the founders. No more than 70 Ether will be available for this first stage.

## Dev Fund

There will be a fund set aside to develop the A&N Platform further. The details of the destination of the proceeds can be found [here](/Proceeds)
