# Investments

## How do members of The LAO make investment decisions?

In the spirit of The DAO, The LAO is entirely member directed and managed and any blockchain-based project can apply for funding from The LAO. As a member, you should have some experience in evaluating and investing in startups relying on digital assets.

Each member will have the opportunity to nominate any applicant for funding through the dapp. Once nominated, members or their delegates will have the right to vote on whether to invest in the project through the dapp.

If members agree via a majority vote to approve an investment, The LAO’s dapp will generate the necessary legal agreements and send them to a designated representative for signature. Once digitally signed, the project will transfer the investment to the project.

A LAO member should understand and acknowledge that they must bear the economic risk of this investment.

## Will The LAO have a general partner?

Unless otherwise agreed to by the members, there will be no general partner.

## Will The LAO operate via a thesis?

The LAO is an emergent experiment and thus there is no express investment thesis for The LAO. Members can work together to formulate a thesis and explore investment opportunities. They have the right to develop any investment thesis they agree on.

## What are the terms of investments made by The LAO?

Members will have the right to set the terms of any investment into projects. By default, and unless otherwise agreed, The LAO’s dapp will be initially configured to make \$100,000 investments in projects (in DAI) via a [convertible note](https://consensys.net/convertible-note/).

The LAO’s dapp has also been the option to be configured to make [series seed](http://seriesseed.com/) investments in projects in exchange for tokenized stock, if the members decide to make a larger investment.

## Can foreign entities receive investment from The LAO?

Initially, The LAO will only make investments in projects treated as c-corporations for US federal income tax purposes.

If members of The LAO decide to invest in other entities, including entities in other jurisdictions, the members by a majority vote, have the right to form one or more legal vehicles or take further action to accommodate the investment.

## What happens if there are multiple proposals for investment? How do The LAO members make decisions?

Proposals are voted on sequentially to ensure that every application for funding is in-fact voted on. It also gives The LAO members time to withdraw their capital (i.e., “rage quit,” described further below) if they do not want to participate in the investment.

## What is the investment period for The LAO?

The LAO has no express investment period. Members can make investment until all contributed capital has been allocated or withdrawn, as discussed further below.

## Does The LAO’s service provider have any rights to make investment decisions?

The service provider has no role in making investment decisions.
