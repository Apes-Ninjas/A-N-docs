# Mechanism Design
The creation of the A&N platform is coupled with the intention of creating a reputation layer on top of the major blockchains, in order to do this correctly we set out to create strong incentives that will create explosive value to all those involved.  

We have created this project by reaching into the bounty of meme culture and the richness of Japanese history, we aim to treat both with respect and make the most to carry on their strength and authenticity into the metaverse.

## How can I acquire an Ape or a Ninja?
In order to acquire the access tokens, you must be here at the right time, and connect your ethereum wallet to the system, your transaction history, current holdings and overall experience will determine the type of Ape or Ninja you can acquire.

## Transaction and asset scoring methodology
Key transactions have 3 scores: 
    1. A general value.
    2. An ape score.
    3. A ninja score.

These are summed up if the general value is above 3000 they will be awarded the highest tier of apes and ninjas, then if the ape score is higher than the ninja score the nature of the access token is awarded. 

To be clear, both Ninjas and Apes are valuable, their energy and activity is what drives and inspires us... But it will be great when we are all ninjas!

## Evolving your Character
Your Access token can evolve, while it will remain  there are several ways to do this, 
### Securing IRL Jungle Rooms
### Making kick ass investments
### Participating and voting in the DAO

## How value is accrued
Value of the A&N token is highly correlated to the strength and diversity of its community, no bonding curves required, just a discerning and vibrant group of individuals that believe in what the A&N ecosystem stands for.

### Monetizing your Clan
Ninjas and higher Apes are able to birth Apes that will be part of their clans, they can then sell them in the A&N Marketplace where they will earn 80% of the sales price while 20% will stay for the A&N treasury.

### Proven rarity
The Apes & Ninjas will have specific character traits that will be awarded to those whose wallets pass to be the higher apes or ninjas.

### Clan reputation & growth

### Access, Access, Access
### Holding is the prize! 

## Access Token

Apes & Ninjas NFT's are more than just a kick ass collectible or a fancy avatar, it is a way to provide access to amazing intel and experiences. The value of an Ape and a Ninja will rise as these experiences and intel evolves, in the future we could as well set a feature to allow users to lease their access tokens with automatic reversion when a date or event passes.

IRL access will also be created by the community by securing "jungle rooms" or perks in recruited establishments, plus the unlocking of prizes or discounts by scanning tags with the A&N app.

### IRL perks
Jōnin Ninjas will be able to choose from a Skin or Street artist theme to birth Apes, after 20 of these are sold in the market, the A&N Dao will send the artist to wherever the Ninja wants to paint a mural or tattoo based on his clan's motifs.

As part of the proceeds from the sales that will be held in the treasury, the DAO will be able to vote on the production or sponsorship of parties and events that will have benefits for the A&N community.  After enough sales are achieved, the A&N DAO will produce the first Apes & Ninjas Family Reunion in a location to be disclosed in the future.

## Intellectual Property and Derivative works.

By owning and holding an Ape or a Ninja, you have wide property rights to commercialize or create derivative works (any other token created with the original work will not have the any rights with the A&N community) each token will include a link to the License Agreement to make things formal.
