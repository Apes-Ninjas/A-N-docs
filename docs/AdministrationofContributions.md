# Administration of Contributions

## How do investors transfer funds into The LAO?

Using a digital wallet, such as MetaMask, members can transfer funds after they have been approved (i.e., verified as an accredited investor, passed KYC/AML checks, etc.). The funds that LAO members contribute into The LAO will initially be held in a smart contract maintained by The LAOâ€™s service provider until The LAO is launched.

## Why are my contributions in ether converted to wrapped eth?

Ether contributions will being wrapped as ERC-20 tokens (wETH) to allow for a seamless interaction with the LAO smart contracts (described further below). The ERC-20 standard streamlines how tokens are tracked and transferred between parties. Ether itself predates the ERC-20 standard, and it did not come with a built in standard of how to track and trade tokens amongst parties. The conversion from ether to wETH address this concern.

## Will all contributions be held in ether or can they be converted to other digital assets?

The members, acting by majority vote, have the right to elect to invest capital contributions to The LAO in either ether, bitcoin and/or fee or interest bearing cryptocurrencies or other digital assets.
