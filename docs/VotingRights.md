# Voting Rights

## How are voting rights determined?

Voting rights will be based on a 1 person 1 vote manner, while we value whales, we want to incentivize participation. 

Only Shoguns will have a tie breaking vote.

## How do members vote?

Members will be prompted to vote via The A&N Platform and in the Governance Telegram group.

Voting is primarily facilitated by blockchain-based smart contracts and all voting records will be searchable via the platform and recorded to the Ethereum blockchain.

For governance-related decisions, The A&N Platform has implemented Snapshot-like voting (which is gas-less) and also has implemented processes to make investment decisions using through gas-less voting tools available via the Platform.

## Simple Majority decisions
When there is a decision to be made around the approval of grants a simple majority will suffice, the only requirement for these decisions to be final is that the term has expired and that the vote was properly announced in the Platform and the Telegram Group.
