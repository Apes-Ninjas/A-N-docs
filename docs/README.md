# What is the LAO?

## What is The LAO?

One of the most promising applications of Ethereum are decentralized (autonomous) organizations also known as DAOs.  In 2013, the Ethereum community saw the first great experiment with DAOs with the launch of “The DAO.”  The DAO raised over $150 million dollars, however failed due to legal and technical challenges. 

The LAO is being organized in the spirit of The DAO, as a member directed venture capital fund organized in the United States, with an aim to be compliant with US law.
  
Like The DAO, The LAO allows Members to pool capital, invest in projects, and share in any proceeds from the investment. 

The LAO is organized as a legal entity (a Delaware limited liability company) primarily administered via an online application (a “dapp”) and related smart contracts.

The LAO will enable its members to vote on project funding proposals and invest in early-stage Ethereum ventures.  Unless modified by the members, funding will be provided to projects in stablecoin, dai, on terms outlined below.  

More details about The LAO’s legal structure, operation, and funding process are outlined in these FAQs.  Please read them carefully before becoming a member of The LAO or seeking funding from The LAO.

# Legal Structure and Operation

General Notes on Legal Structure

## What is the legal structure of the LAO?

The LAO is organized as a Delaware limited liability company.  

The rights and obligations of LAO members are set forth in an operating agreement and are supplemented by the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act.  **You should retain your own counsel for purposes of evaluating whether to join The LAO as a member.** 

At its core, The LAO will be member-managed and rely on a dapp and related smart contracts to facilitate investments into projects using digital assets. 

Unlike The DAO, which was arguably an implied partnership that provided members with limited legal protection, The LAO’s operating agreement expressly limits the members’ liability and limits any fiduciary obligations amongst members to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

The LAO will rely on a service provider (initially, OpenLaw) to facilitate various administrative functions on behalf of the members, including preparing and sending annual K-1 tax forms, updating and maintaining the dapp, validating information related to projects selected for investment, and handling other interactions that may come up during the lifetime of The LAO (e.g., receiving the proceeds from the sale of securities in fiat and converting them to a digital asset for distribution to members).  For these services, the service provider will receive a fee, pursuant to a schedule outlined below.

The LAO’s operating agreement was prepared by OpenLaw’s outside counsel.

## Will members enjoy limited liability?

As set forth in the operating agreement, and except as otherwise provided under Delaware law, no member (or former member) of The LAO will be liable for the obligations of The LAO for any amounts in excess of the amount of the member’s contributions to The LAO, plus: 

-the member’s share of the undistributed profits of The LAO, if any; and

-any amounts distributed by The LAO to such member.

## What are the fiduciary obligations between Members?

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, members shall not have any fiduciary duty to The LAO or any other member.  Under the operating agreement, members agree to interact in good faith and to engage in fair dealing.

## Can members make seperate investments in or provide services to projects that receive investments from the LAO?

Under the operating agreement, members may provide services to, make investments in, and provide financing to any project financed by The LAO.

## Can members vary the operating agreement or the ways in which The LAO operates?

The terms and provisions of the operating agreement may be amended if 50% or more of the LAO members, or their delegates, vote to approve the amendment.  Voting will be based on the number of LAO Tokens held by the members at the time of the vote.

## What are the tax issues with The LAO?

Each member of The LAO must rely on the member’s own tax and legal representatives as to the tax consequences of joining The LAO or making investments through The LAO.

# Investment Decisions

## How do members of The LAO make investment decisions?

In the spirit of The DAO, The LAO is entirely member directed and managed and any blockchain-based project can apply for funding from The LAO.  As a member, you should have some experience in evaluating and investing in startups relying on digital assets.  

Each member will have the opportunity to nominate any applicant for funding through the dapp.  Once nominated, members or their delegates will have the right to vote on whether to invest in the project through the dapp.

If members agree via a majority vote to approve an investment, The LAO’s dapp will generate the necessary legal agreements and send them to a designated representative for signature.  Once digitally signed, the project will transfer the investment to the project.

A LAO member should understand and acknowledge that they must bear the economic risk of this investment.  

## Will The LAO have a general partner?

Unless otherwise agreed to by the members, there will be no general partner.

## Will The LAO operate via a thesis?

The LAO is an emergent experiment and thus there is no express investment thesis for The LAO.  Members can work together to formulate a thesis and explore investment opportunities.  They have the right to develop any investment thesis they agree on.

## What are the terms of investments made by The LAO?

Members will have the right to set the terms of any investment into projects.  By default, and unless otherwise agreed, The LAO’s dapp will be initially configured to make $100,000 investments in projects (in DAI) via a [convertible note](https://consensys.net/convertible-note/).

The LAO’s dapp has also been the option to be configured to make [series seed](http://seriesseed.com/) investments in projects in exchange for tokenized stock, if the members decide to make a larger investment.

## Can foreign entities receive investment from The LAO?

Initially, The LAO will only make investments in projects treated as c-corporations for US federal income tax purposes.

If members of The LAO decide to invest in other entities, including entities in other jurisdictions, the members by a majority vote, have the right to form one or more legal vehicles or take further action to accommodate the investment.

## What happens if there are multiple proposals for investment?  How do The LAO members make decisions?

Proposals are voted on sequentially to ensure that every application for funding is in-fact voted on.   It also gives The LAO members time to withdraw their capital (i.e., “rage quit,” described further below) if they do not want to participate in the investment.

## What is the investment period for The LAO?

The LAO has no express investment period.  Members can make investment until all contributed capital has been allocated or withdrawn, as discussed further below.

## Does The LAO’s service provider have any rights to make investment decisions?

The service provider has no role in making investment decisions.

# Opting out of Investment Decisions (i.e., “rage quitting”)

## What happens if I do not want to participate in an investment?

Members are not obligated to participate in any proposed investment.  Once an investment is authorized by a majority vote of the members, all members will have the right to opt out of the investment and receive any undeployed capital that they contributed to The LAO back (i.e., “rage quit”).

The right to rage quit is accounted for in the operating agreement and facilitated via the dapp and underlying smart contracts.

## If I "rage quit" can I sell my interests in The LAO?

If a member ragequits, the member’s original unallocated capital contribution will be returned to the member.  The members’ LAO tokens are retired (i.e., “burned”) and the member loses any right to participate in future investments.  

The member will retain any previous rights to proceeds from investments that occurred before “rage-quitting,” as detailed further below.

## When can a member "ragequit?"

A member can "ragequit" The LAO at any time, including after any funding proposal.  The only restriction is that any proposal that particular member voted "YES" is processed by The LAO smart contract initially.

# Delegating Rights to Make Investment Decisions

## Can a member transfer their voting rights for purposes of making investment decisions?

A member can transfer or “delegate” the member’s right to vote on investment decisions by designating an ethereum address via the dapp voting rights to another Ethereum address via the dapp.

## Does delegating rights to vote on investment decisions impact a member’s right to proceeds?

Under the operating agreement, a member’s decision to delegate voting rights does not change The LAO member’s right to proceeds from any investment.

## Can a Member cancel and/or re-delegate their voting rights?

A member can cancel and/or re-delegate a member’s voting rights through the dapp at any time.

# Due Diligence

## What information will members receive from projects?

Projects apply for investment through The LAO’s dapp.  Applicants will submit relevant information about their project, including a background of founders, pitch deck, and/or relevant financial  information.

If members believe that additional information should be collected from an applicant, the member can contact the project directly or ask the service provider to obtain the information on The LAO’s behalf. 

## Will members have the opportunity to conduct due diligence on the various startups applying for funding?

Members are free to contact projects and conduct due diligence on any startups that have applied to receive financing from The LAO.

The LAO will maintain various ways interact with applicants and projects, such as Telegram, Discourse, and Slack channels.   If requested by the members, The LAO’s service provider can schedule meetings or facilitate other interactions with any applicants that are being considered by members for investment.

## Can members request that additional or different types of information be collected from projects?

Members have the right to control all operations of The LAO and any changes can be implemented by the service provider.

# Proceeds from Investments

## Should LAO members expect to receive any profit by contributing to The LAO?

Investments contemplated by The LAO are inherently speculative and are made by The LAO members or their express designees and agents.  The results of the LAO’s investments will likely vary from period to period, and investments made by the LAO will involve a high degree of financial and market risk that can result in a complete loss of any member’s contribution to the LAO.

## If I’m a member of The LAO, what interest do I receive in any projects that receive financing from The LAO?

The LAO will be the record holder of all securities and/or any other rights secured via LAO-related investments.   Members, acting via a majority vote, will have the right to determine the amount, timing, and form of all distributions related to proceeds from those investments.

## How will proceeds be distributed?

Members will receive proceeds, if any, on a pro-rata basis based on the number of LAO tokens each member holds.

If a member “rage quits” they will be entitled to receive proceeds from any investments made by the LAO prior to the member’s withdrawal of capital.  However, they will not be entitled to distribution with respect to any investments made by The LAO after the date they quit The LAO.

Please note, that prior to proceed distribution, members must provide a copy of the applicable Form W-9 or Form W-8, when requested by the software provider. 

## Will proceeds be paid in ether, dai, or cash?

Members have the right to determine how proceeds will be paid.

## Can The LAO recycle or reinvest proceeds?

Members acting by a majority vote may reinvest or retain for investment any proceeds to effect LAO investments, pay expenses (outlined below), or create reserves.

# Fees, Expenses, and Carry

## Does The LAO charge a carry?

Because The LAO does not have any general partner, no member of The LAO or the service provider will be entitled to a carry.

## If there are expenses associated with operating The LAO, who is responsible for them?

The LAO is responsible for all costs and expenses related to its activities, operations, and maintenance, as detailed in the operating agreement.  This includes any fees charged by the service provider.

## Are there any fees are associated with The LAO?

As noted above, The LAO contemplates the use of a service provider to help facilitate, on behalf of the members, activity on The LAO.  As compensation for these services, the service provider will initially charge the following fees.  

| Year          | Service Provider Annual Fee| 
| ------------- |:--------------------------:| 
| 1             | 2%                         | 
| 2             | 1.6875%                    | 
| 3             | 1.0625%                    |
| 4             | 0.75%                      |

All fees are payable on a quarterly basis to the service provider and will begin to accrue once The LAO launches.

# Contributing to The LAO

## How can I contribute to the LAO and become a member?

Membership in The LAO is currently limited to accredited investors, as defined under US law.  The total number of members will be capped at a maximum of 100 members.

Members will be permitted to join The LAO through The LAO’s dapp starting on or about mid-February (there will be a public announcement shortly).    

Once open, members will have the opportunity to pledge ether to The LAO by purchasing tokens representing an ownership in The LAO.  

Tokens will be sold in blocks.  Each block of LAO Tokens will provide a member with 1% of the voting rights in The LAO, along with 1% pro rata rights to any proceeds from investments.  

Each member will be permitted to purchase up to nine blocks of LAO Tokens (or 9% in total) for a maximum purchase price of $225,000 (USD).

The sale will be denominated in USD but settled in ether.  To calculate the amount of ether necessary to complete a pledge and subscription The LAO will rely on a real time oracle feed provided by ChainLink.

## Are The LAO tokens securities?

The LAO tokens have not been approved or disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, any State Securities Commission in the US or other global regulatory authority.

## Can I contribute bitcoin, dai, or other assets to The LAO?

All contributions are currently only limited to ether, unless the members agree otherwise. 

## Why is membership in the LAO limited to accredited investors and 100 members?

As noted above, the United States Securities Exchange Commission and/or equivalent government bodies in other jurisdictions have not determined whether membership interests in The LAO (represented as tokens) are securities.

In the abundance of caution, the limits in membership and accreditation status are put in place to: 

-comply with US securities law;
-prevent any one party from controlling a disproportionate amount of The LAO; and 
-limit the risk of look through issues for LAO Members that are organized as funds or other legal entities.

## Are there any other requirements needed to become a member?

To contribute Ethereum to The LAO, members will need to be accredited investor check and anti-money laundering (“AML”) and Know Your Customer (“KYC”) checks, as defined under US law and as discussed further below, and will need to deposit a sufficient amount of ether in their address in order to complete the bid.

Members will also need to submit sufficient information to verify the potential member’s identity for AML/KYC & OFAC checks, including:

-Uploading a passport or a state issued license;
-Providing a social security number or Tax ID; and
-Providing proof of the member’s primary residence.

Accredited investors include:

-Individuals who have an annual income exceeding $200K or a married couple that has joint income spouse exceeding $300K in the two most recent years and have a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level this year.
-Individuals who have a net worth that exceeds $1 million (excluding the individual’s primary residence).

In addition to legal entities such as:

-Funds and trusts, with total assets in excess of $5 million, which were not formed specifically to purchase the subject securities, whose purchase is directed by someone who has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the merits and risks of the prospective investment.
-Any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors.

The full definition can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-accredhtm.html).

In order to register as a member, and validate potential members will need to supply The LAO with sufficient information to assess whether the member meets these legal requirements.  

# Accreditation Process

## How do I establish my accreditation status?

During member onboarding, members will be asked to provide applicable documentation in order for The LAO to verify your status as an accredited investor.  This may include:

-Documentation verifying your income or net worth;
-written confirmation from a registered broker-dealer or investment advisor, licensed attorney, or certified public accountant as to the member’s accreditation status; and
-various forms, including a Form W-2, Form 1099, bank or brokerage statements, other statements of securities holdings, and other applicable documentation to ensure that you meet the definition of an accredited investor.

If you’re acting on behalf of a legal entity, you may need to provide:

-Verification of that entity’s assets; and
-Verification of your sophistication

## I'm a foreign investor interested in becoming a member of The LAO. Are non-U.S. investors able to become a member in The LAO?

Non-U.S. based investors are permitted to become members of The LAO.  At this time, non-U.S. based investors must also go through the accredited investor check. 

## How long does it take to verify my accreditation?

Accreditation will take several business days to be processed by The LAO.  We will notify you during the verification, with any questions or concerns.  

## Who will see the accreditation and other documents that I upload?  Can members of the LAO maintain a degree of anonymity?

The documentation that you upload as evidence of your accreditation status are kept private and are used to verify that you meet the definition of an accredited investor.  The information will not be disclosed to other members of The LAO, unless voluntarily disclosed by the member via the dapp or otherwise required by law.

# Administration of Contributions

## How do investors transfer funds into The LAO?

Using a digital wallet, such as MetaMask, members can transfer funds after they have been approved (i.e., verified as an accredited investor, passed KYC/AML checks, etc.).  The funds that LAO members contribute into The LAO will initially be held in a smart contract maintained by The LAO’s service provider until The LAO is launched.

## Why are my contributions in ether converted to wrapped eth?

Ether contributions will being wrapped as ERC-20 tokens (wETH) to allow for a seamless interaction with the LAO smart contracts (described further below).  The ERC-20 standard streamlines how tokens are tracked and transferred between parties.  Ether itself predates the ERC-20 standard, and it did not come with a built in standard of how to track and trade tokens amongst parties.  The conversion from ether to wETH address this concern.

## Will all contributions be held in ether or can they be converted to other digital assets?

The members, acting by majority vote, have the right to elect to invest capital contributions to The LAO in either ether, bitcoin and/or fee or interest bearing cryptocurrencies or other digital assets.

# Transfer of LAO Tokens and New LAO Members

## Will LAO tokens be transferrable?

With limited exception, detailed in the operating agreement, members cannot transfer LAO tokens unless otherwise agreed to by the members.

## If a member “rage quits” and leaves The LAO can new members join?

Members, by a majority vote, can accept new capital commitments from other members and admit them into The LAO.  Any new member (or, if applicable group of members) must provide the same initial contribution as an exiting member. 

## Can a member be forced out of The LAO?

Members of The LAO may be required to leave if members of The LAO vote to remove the respective member.  The software provider cannot remove any LAO member unless the members vote to remove.

# Launch of The LAO

## When will The LAO launch, sufficient to allow members to make investments?

The LAO will accept projects and investors prior to the launch date.  Please begin the application process here. 

The sale will continue until all of the tokens in The LAO are sold or , whichever event happens sooner. 

# Termination or Dissolution of The LAO

## Under what circumstances will The LAO wind down?

Members of The LAO can  by majority vote, to wind down The LAO.  Other such circumstances include a judicially ordered dissolution or disposition of all the assets of The LAO. 

If dissolution were to occur, a person appointed by the Members,by majority vote, will handle the wind down of The LAO based on the terms of the operating agreement.

## What happens if there are expenses related to the dissolution?

If dissolution were to occur, members of The LAO would be responsible for the expenses associated with the liquidator, in connection with winding up the LAO.

Any additional losses or liabilities incurred will be in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement.
