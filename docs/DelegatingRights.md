# Voting Rights

## How are voting rights determined?

Voting rights will be based on the total number of LAO Tokens that each member holds for any relevant vote posed to members.

## How do members vote?

Members will be prompted to vote via the dapp (or, over time, other online services) at various points during the lifecycle of The LAO, including to evaluate investment decisions, weigh-in on the structure and form of The LAO, and/or other strategic decisions related to The LAO.

Voting will be facilitated by blockchain-based smart contracts and all voting records will be searchable via the dapp and recorded to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Can a member transfer their voting rights for purposes of making investment decisions?

Members are not required to vote on all matters. At any point in time, a member can transfer or “delegate” the member’s right to vote on investment decisions by designating an Ethereum address via the dapp. Decisions to delegate any voting rights are entirely up to each member.

## Does delegating rights to vote on investment decisions impact a member’s right to proceeds?

Under the operating agreement, a member’s decision to delegate voting rights does not change The LAO member’s right to proceeds from any investment.

## Can a Member cancel and/or re-delegate their voting rights?

A member can cancel and/or re-delegate a member’s voting rights through the dapp at any time.
