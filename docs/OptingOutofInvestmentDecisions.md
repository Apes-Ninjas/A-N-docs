# Opting out of Investment Decisions (i.e., “rage quitting”)

## What happens if I do not want to participate in an investment?

Members are not obligated to participate in any proposed investment.  Once an investment is authorized by a majority vote of the members, all members will have the right to opt out of the investment and receive any undeployed capital that they contributed to The LAO back (i.e., “rage quit”).

The right to rage quit is accounted for in the operating agreement and facilitated via the dapp and underlying smart contracts.

## If I "rage quit" can I sell my interests in The LAO?

If a member ragequits, the member’s original unallocated capital contribution will be returned to the member.  The members’ LAO tokens are retired (i.e., “burned”) and the member loses any right to participate in future investments.  

The member will retain any previous rights to proceeds from investments that occurred before “rage-quitting,” as detailed further below.

## When can a member "ragequit?"

A member can "ragequit" The LAO at any time, including after any funding proposal.  The only restriction is that any proposal that particular member voted "YES" is processed by The LAO smart contract initially.
