# LAO Tokens and New Members

## Will LAO tokens be transferrable?

With limited exception, detailed in the operating agreement, members cannot transfer LAO tokens unless otherwise agreed to by the members.

## If a member “rage quits” and leaves The LAO can new members join?

Members, by a majority vote, can accept new capital commitments from other members and admit them into The LAO. Any new member (or, if applicable group of members) must provide the same initial contribution as an exiting member.

## Can a member be forced out of The LAO?

Members of The LAO may be required to leave if members of The LAO vote to remove the respective member. The software provider cannot remove any LAO member unless the members vote to remove.
