Like The DAO, The LAO allows Members to pool capital, invest in projects, and share in any proceeds from the investment.

The LAO is organized as a legal entity (a Delaware limited liability company) primarily administered via an online application (a "DApp") and related smart contracts.

Launched in late April 2020, the LAO has backed over 30 projects across the Ethereum and blockchain ecosystem. Unless modified by the members, funding will be provided to projects in the form of the cryptocurrency Ether under terms outlined in these FAQs.

More details about The LAO's legal structure, operation, and funding process are outlined in these FAQs. Please read them carefully before becoming a member of The LAO or seeking funding from The LAO.
