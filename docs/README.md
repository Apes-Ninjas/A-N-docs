# Apes & Ninjas Manifesto

**We are the Guardians of the Metaverse and the IRL**

## Apes of the Metaverse...

A powerful shift is taking place.  Through the Metaverse we are finding new and exciting ways to build that which we have been deprived of, financial security, and rescue the hope that we can do better than those that came before us.  

We are rallying together to upend the status quo, and move reality forward in a better and more inclusive manner.  But not everything requires that we ape on and hold diamond hands as a pack!  We need to recognize that there are those that do better DD, those that never get a rug pull, those that we can trust to provide the right signals for us to do what we do best and ape together strong... 

## We need Ninjas! 

By recognizing the ninjas, we are tipping our hat to those that have helped move the crypto space forward, not by avoiding risk, but by embracing it and properly evaluating it.  The ninja are skillful and from antiquity have been deployed to gather intelligence to act upon and secure a keep. The ninja are secretive and know that their traditions and skills must be protected and guarded from those that could do ill with them.  These are the traits of the ninja we aspire.

By celebrating the apes, we are providing a space to be who you are no matter the creed, race or political inclination, we are strong together, and thus we will be guarding this space to be free of divisive rhetoric and postures.  We apes are the base and true power in our movement, We are the guardians of the Metaverse, ushering all that is good from the Metaverse and bringing it to the digital and Real Life. 

## Apes & Ninjas of the Metaverse...

 ### The future is here and it is open to us!  The changing of the guard is upon us, and we have all that is required to bring about the change that will go beyond a "Reset" or a "better" backing to rebuild, we are the change that is not foreseen, the black swan in form of a pack of Gorillas that are guided to shape the world to our needs. 
### We are not looking to create an alternative, we are going to take over the existing structures and make them adapt to our needs for free a sovereign existence.

* We will do this in an Autonomous and Distributed manner, The A&N DAO will be represented on a 1 Person 1 Vote manner, and only those that believe in what we do and place their capital and effort (Shoguns) will have a casting vote (tie-breaker).  Governance will be done with the NJN token.

* We will bring the Metaverse to IRL (In Real Life).  Physical interactions matter! The more businesses and service we enroll to the crypto space, the better we will be able to bare the bears, these will serve as the local and regional headquarters for the A&N Community, there will be a tag placed in these hollowed places, that can be accessed via an AR application available to Apes & Ninja holders.

* We will also take over the digital space, reclaiming freedom of speech by encoding all messages directed to Apes & Ninjas in an emoji cypher, only the Apes & Ninja holders will be able to make sense of these messages, and engage in truly open and free conversations.


* Narrative is important, but just because we like to create stories, does it mean that those stories don't matter, there is freedom in creativity, and that freedom provides the cover for us to target an objective.  Once you understand the cypher, keep it to yourself, knowledge and information are valuable. If someone wants access they must become an Ape or a Ninja.

* The project is going to be governed, not with legitimacy, but with coherence to these principles, any amendment or addition will be done by the A&N DAO.

### Is this the real life? 
### Is this just fantasy?
### Caught in a landslide,
### No escape from reality
### Open your eyes,
### Look up to the skies and see...
