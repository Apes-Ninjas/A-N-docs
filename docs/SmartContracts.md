# Smart Contracts

## What smart contracts are being used?

The A&N DAO uses various smart contracts to administer its activity. Primarily, the smart contracts are used to facilitate:

- collecting A&N's take from sales;
- voting;
- Grant Awarding;
- distributing proceeds; and

The A&N DAO currently uses v2 of the MolochDAO's smart contracts, which can be found [here](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch).


## Will the smart contract code be publicly available?

The smart contract code will be publicly available on Etherscan and GitHub when it is complete.
