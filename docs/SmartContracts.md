# The LAO Smart Contracts

## What smart contracts are being used for the LAO?

The LAO uses various smart contracts to administer its activity. Primarily, the smart contracts are used to facilitate:

- Collection of members’ initial contributions to the LAO;
- Voting;
- Delegating Voting to Third Parties;
- Funding investments;
- Distributing proceeds; and
- Rage quitting.

The LAO uses v2 of the MolochDAO’s smart contracts, which can be found [here](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch).
