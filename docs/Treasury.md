## Management of funds

Using a digital wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or a wallet compatible with [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) members can contribute to the LAO after they have been approved (i.e., verified as an accredited investor, passed KYC/AML checks, etc., as applicable and as further outlined [here](/Membership)).

## Featured Artists

Ether contributions will be wrapped as ERC-20 tokens (wETH) to allow for a seamless interaction with The LAO smart contracts (described further [here](/SmartContracts)). The ERC-20 standard streamlines how tokens are tracked and transferred between parties. Ether itself predates the ERC-20 standard, and it did not come with a built in standard of how to track and trade tokens amongst parties. The conversion from Ether to wETH addresses this concern.

## Community Building

The members, acting by majority vote, have the right to elect to invest capital contributions to The LAO in either Ether, Bitcoin, and/or fee or interest bearing cryptocurrencies or other digital assets.
