# Clan Membership

## If I have a clan or I am a member, what type of information is shared?

The initial functionality of the A&N platform will present the public information that is available around the A&N's member wallet, but it will be presented in a way where the transactions, tokens and other assets are scored and are deconstructed so all in the clan can share the collective knowledge. 

Sharing actionable data and providing analysis in the discussions will have incentives, the collective performance of the clan will have an impact in the value of the Access Tokens and secure a store of value for the experience and information shared.

## How can I recruit Apes to my Clan?
Apes can be recruited to a clan in 2 ways.

1. Selling or Awarding an Ape of your Clan
2. Recruiting a Rogue Ape

## Can I boot an Ape from my Clan?
Here is where you have to be really careful, when you transfer an Ape from your clan, that transaction is final, and they will always be a part of it.  That is why these Apes will be expensive. 

Now Rogue Apes that you recruit can be ousted from your clan, so you can add them sparingly.
