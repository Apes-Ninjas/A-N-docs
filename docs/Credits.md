Apes & Ninjas could not exist if it wasn't for the inspiration and support (for the moment indirect) of:

### [WallStreetBets]("https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"): The initial inspiration for the project.
### [Bankless]("https://banklesshq.com/"): For their amazing work educating the core group on everything DeFi and Ethereum.

### [Atomic]("https://atomic.blue/"): Their Degen Score system was instrumental for creating the A&N Platform.
### [The LAO]("https://www.thelao.io/"): Provided the tangible tools for us to strive and move in the right direction.

### [OpenLaw]("https://www.openlaw.io/"): Is the origin of the smart contracts and the current documentation engine we are using.

### [Etherscan]("https://etherscan.io/"), [Ethplorer]("https://ethplorer.io/") Their API's are amazing 

### [Bored Ape Yacht Club]("https://boredapeyachtclub.com/"): Our kin, you beat us to it, and you showed us a better way of doing things. We pay homage to you and also extend all of the benefits and features of the A&N Platform to you all.  (Including being part of the DAO, remember to claim your NJN tokens when they are out)
